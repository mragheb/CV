CV
==

These are the source files for my CV.

It was built using the tutorial by ?Kamil Wojcicki? 'latex — professional résumé layout made simple' here: 
http://linux.dsplabs.com.au/resume-writing-example-latex-template-linux-curriculum-vitae-professional-cv-layout-format-text-p54/

I don't know much about latex, so much of the spacing in my CV might seem fairly hacky ;)

If you find it useful please do fork it and make your own! The real magic is in the template file which I didn't create.
